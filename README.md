# The Web Developer Bootcamp FAQ App

<!-- Hey everyone - quick update on the remote hackathon idea
I'm finding it difficult to plan such an event, so I've decided that I'm going to share a project I started and anyone who wants to contribute can do so. This will be a good way to add "contributed to open source" to your resumes, and gain some real world developing experience.
If you'd like to join in then checkout the repo for the project here - https://github.com/nax3t/wdb-faq
You can fork and clone it if you want to make pull requests on a new branch
The project is basically this:
Create a simple and intuitive FAQ application where students and instructors/TA's can submit frequently asked questions and give them tags so they're easily searchable.
This would be in an effort to make the solutions to commonly asked questions on Udemy easier to find by all.

Let me know what you all think. Thanks! -->
